# LRC LIBRARY: Service Management
A web program designed to help students and faculty manage their LRC needs, making it easier to plan services and avoid physical trips for simple tasks.
# OVERVIEW
Busy schedules for both students and faculty make it difficult to plan for services at the learning resource center. This program was created to solve that problem by allowing people to access LRC services without having to go to the library in person.
# What It Does
Through our program, we will manage the following services:

**• Announcements:** Sends timely news and updates regarding library matters.

**• LRC Auditorium Reservations:** Allow users to book the auditorium for school projects like presentations, group work, and orientations

**• Printing Services:** Provide information on the availability of ink and paper.

**• Borrowing:** Let people reserve books, computers, and other items ahead of time.

**• Reminders:** Send automatic reminders to ensure borrowed items are returned on time.
# Objectives
